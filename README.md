*feeder (small container ship)* 

a Raspberry Pi 3B+ cluster with docker and - as an option-  ready to install docker swarm with portainer gui or kubernetes. All worker nodes operate in a diskless mode.


*Network booting works only for the wired adapter. Booting over **wireless LAN** is not supported.
It is also important that there is already a **working DHCP server** on the local network.*
